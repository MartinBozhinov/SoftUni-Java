•	Read 20 numbers for both players
•	Numbers will be Integer, separated with " " (single space).
•	Every player can hold only unique numbers 
•	Each Round both players get the top number from their own deck. Player with the bigger number get both numbers and add it on the bottom of his own sequence
•	Game ends after 50 rounds or if any player lose all of his numbers
•	Output must be "First Player Win!", "Second Player Win!" or "Draw!"

•	Think where to check if any player is without cards
•	When you find top number, be sure to remove it immediately
