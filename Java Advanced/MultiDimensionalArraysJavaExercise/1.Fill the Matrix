Filling a matrix in the regular way (top to bottom and left to right) is boring. Write two methods that fill a matrix of size N x N in two different patterns. Both patterns are described below:
Pattern A                  	Pattern B
1 5 9 13                    1 8 9  16
2 6 10 14                   2 7 10 15 
3 7 11 15                   3 6 11 14
4 8 12 16                   4 5 12 13
